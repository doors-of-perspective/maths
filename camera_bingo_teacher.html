      // Core Camera Settings
      "Manual Mode": "A camera setting where you control aperture, shutter speed, and ISO yourself.",
      "ISO": "Controls the camera's sensitivity to light; higher ISO = brighter but more noise.",
      "Shutter Speed": "How long the shutter stays open; affects motion blur and exposure.",
      "Aperture": "The size of the lens opening; affects depth of field and exposure.",
      "White Balance": "Adjusts colors to make whites look neutral under different lighting.",
      "Depth of Field": "How much of the image is in focus; shallow = blurred background.",
      "Exposure Triangle": "The relationship between ISO, shutter speed, and aperture.",
      "Focus Pull": "Changing focus from one subject to another in a shot.",
      "Dynamic Range": "The range of light between the darkest and brightest areas a camera can capture.",
      
      // Composition
      "Rule of Thirds": "Divides the frame into thirds; subjects placed on lines look balanced.",
      "Leading Lines": "Lines in the scene that guide the viewerâ€™s eyes to the subject.",
      "Symmetry": "When both sides of the frame mirror each other for balance.",
      "Framing": "Using objects in the scene to frame the subject.",
      "Head Space": "The space above a subjectâ€™s head; too much or too little feels awkward.",
      "Negative Space": "Empty space that surrounds the subject, emphasizing them.",
      "Balance": "Visually even distribution of elements in the frame.",
      "Foreground Interest": "Objects in the front that add depth and context.",
      "Point of View (POV)": "The angle or perspective from which the camera views the scene.",
      
      // Shot Types
      "Close Up": "A shot focusing tightly on a subjectâ€™s face or object detail.",
      "Extreme Close Up": "Very tight shot showing small details like eyes or hands.",
      "Medium Close Up": "Frames from chest up; used for interviews.",
      "Wide Shot": "Shows the full subject and their surroundings.",
      "Establishing Shot": "Sets the sceneâ€™s location at the start of a sequence.",
      "Over-the-Shoulder": "Camera placed behind a character to show their view.",
      "Two Shot": "A shot including two people, often in conversation.",
      "Low Angle": "Camera is below the subject; makes them look powerful.",
      "High Angle": "Camera looks down on the subject; makes them look smaller or weaker.",

      // Lighting
      "Key Light": "Main light source; defines shape and detail.",
      "Fill Light": "Softens shadows created by the key light.",
      "Back Light": "Lights subject from behind; creates separation.",
      "Three-Point Lighting": "Setup using key, fill, and back lights.",
      "Silhouette": "Subject appears dark against a bright background.",
      "Hard Light": "Strong shadows; creates dramatic effect.",
      "Soft Light": "Gentle shadows; flattering for portraits.",
      "Practical Light": "Visible light source in the scene (e.g. lamp).",

      // Movement
      "Pan": "Camera rotates horizontally.",
      "Tilt": "Camera rotates vertically.",
      "Tracking Shot": "Camera moves alongside or follows subject.",
      "Handheld": "Shot with camera held by hand; feels natural or chaotic.",
      "Static Shot": "Camera stays completely still.",
      "Rack Focus": "Shift focus from one subject to another.",
      "Zoom": "Lens changes focal length to magnify.",
      "Dolly Zoom": "Camera moves opposite to zoom for a disorienting effect.",
      "Whip Pan": "Fast pan creating a blur effect.",

      // Creative Concepts
      "Mise-en-ScÃ¨ne": "Everything in the frame â€“ setting, props, lighting, costume, acting.",
      "Composition": "The arrangement of visual elements in a frame.",
      "Continuity": "Consistent visual flow between shots.",
      "Match Cut": "A cut between two visually similar shots.",
      "Jump Cut": "Abrupt cut that skips time or action.",
      "Montage": "Sequence of shots showing time passing or a theme.",
      "180-Degree Rule": "Keeping the camera on one side of the action line for spatial consistency.",
      "Shot Reverse Shot": "Alternating shots between characters in dialogue.",

      // Technical
      "Noise": "Grainy distortion caused by high ISO or low light.",
      "Grain": "Film texture that adds character or grit.",
      "Frame Rate": "Number of frames per second; affects motion smoothness.",
      "Resolution": "Number of pixels in the image; affects detail.",
      "Aspect Ratio": "Shape of the frame (e.g. 16:9 widescreen).",
      "Sensor Size": "Physical size of the camera sensor; affects depth of field and quality.",
      "Bokeh": "Aesthetic quality of blurred background lights.",
      "Histogram": "Graph showing brightness distribution in an image.",
      "Overexposure": "Too much light; details lost in highlights.",
      "Underexposure": "Too little light; details lost in shadows."
